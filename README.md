# tic-tac-toe-plus
It's a Tic-Tac-Toe game, but you have to put 5 Xs or Os in a row.

Yeah so Well, it's a tic-tac-toe game. There's a menu, where you can choose PvP (Player vs AI coming...), 
and than you play tic-tac-toe. The software check's if one of the player put 5 symbols in a row, and the shows the winner. 
If you manage to fill all the fields, it's a draw, but nothing happens.

This is the first python project that I consider as finished.
